- erp for non-profit or other software to digitize third sector operations. to understand willingness to pay of the third sector (to be segmented obviously between small medium large)

- equity management platform like carta.com that allows you to do fundraising with safe and priced round from the notary completely digitally or even integrating with crowdfunding and allows you to set up the company if you need it (like lexdo perhaps integrating with them)

- web app saas of personal finance that allows you to monitor your finances make projections etc integrating with real time current account data (maybe even integrate with brokers to automate investments) - competitor spendee missing 2fa and missing transfers between accounts - missing automatic reconciliation of reimbursements from friends when you advance money.

- platform to find independent financial advisor. habits.inc exists in the US world and uelt.io in Italy but I think it closed because the site is down. at the moment this search is done for acquaintances and there is no transparency. for italy it could become something like fiscozen where the customer registers, we assign them a partner consultant, they pay a fee to us and we pass it on to the consultant, removing the crest (they pay the fee plus the brokerage fee). we need to understand if the pain is only the matching or also the inefficiency of the customer experience as in the case of old-fashioned accountants (fiscozen solves that) - fiscozen of financial consultancy - it can also be done like habits which monetizes the fin advisor side and sells it as an acquisition channel for fin advisors. you can also think about doing it on a subscription basis on the end user side. we also need to understand pricing because I have the feeling that young people would like a financial advisor but it is too expensive - hear gian and ele to understand how much they pay

- escrow company for rental contracts that holds the deposits on behalf of the tenant and landlord

- spaces to explore

- digitalization of the third sector

- journalism crisis and disinformation

- digital tools for professional firms (lawyers, accountants, notaries, architects, engineers, designers)

- future of work - the future belongs to small cities - coworking in medium-small cities like savona - like switchyards

- saas to transform bars and restaurants into coworking (nibol was like this but it pivoted, understand why)

- platform to help street musicians earn a living through digital tips and a totem to show with qr with information on suggestions on places where they play albums etc etc. it would be cool to find a way to automatically attribute views of stories and content made by passers-by to the musician (AI?) - it already exists - the busking project

- hiring service for startups by vetting candidates and sourcing through communities

- parallel payment circuit sardex style but for the third sector where nonprofits can exchange goods and services without using legal currency. interesting to extend to for-profit companies to allow them to provide services to non-profits in exchange for credits that can then be spent elsewhere - interesting for them in terms of corporate social responsibility

- accounting software for SMEs ai driven type ramp

- rental process digitalization software
immobiliare.it meets jet hr in the sense that the customer finds the house on the platform, makes a request, visits in person, the contract is made and signed online, payments and communications travel via the platform

- real estate investment platform for gen z
offer either low and fixed interest without a lump sum lock not on specific capital development in (it becomes like deposits for a bank from the company's point of sale) or high interest but on a specific project and with a lock in

- do real estate valuation with ai using internet data on "lateral" information such as neighborhood attendance to evaluate properties and find undervalued assets

- market research database improved with ai that goes beyond ateco codes and solves all the inefficiencies of market research as is

- management for condominiums
thousandths management, convening and recording meetings, payments to the administrator

- intersections between blockchain and logistics

- job board Italian startups only NON-tech jobs - full of stem job boards but I don't know any non-stem - it must become a point of reference very quickly to work

- using the cooperative formula to give members a way to test the products and services they want to launch on the market without having to open their own structure —> *back office platform and legal structure as a service*
potential market is all those who want to start a side hustle but don't want to risk opening an LLC or quit and open a VAT number right away, ditto budding creators and influencers, freelancers at the beginning or people who want to become freelancers later
-> let's democratize access to entrepreneurship
platform that allows anyone to test their side hustle without opening a VAT number

- online accounting software that can be easily integrated with any other saas like quickbooks online but in the Italian version (I don't think quickbooks or xero are compliant in Italy)

- cloud accounting like xero that also lets you pay taxes on ires irap iva (no employees for that there is jet but you do integration) and automatic tax credits with pervasive ai that suggests optimization of spending and tax credits to request

- media company that produces and scales newsletters freemium on hyper-specific niches —> use ai to hyper-customize on the final reader

- ai x get european funding: there is a lot of money that the country can't spend because they don't know how to apply. bonus x AI version for european funding

- ai to summarize content that people would like to consume but don't have time for: it analyzes sources saved with pocket-type tools and creates an integrated summary and extracts insights with references, it can be generated both in email and in doc or as one prefers

- ai x user interview

- app to report the presence of a tire inflation pump for motorcyclists

- platform to facilitate meetings between people via AI database - boardy

- open source erp customizable from scratch for consulting firms / those who work on commission

- make it easier to buy/renovate a house for our generation.

- peer to peer mortgages?

- book sharing platform: users can lend and borrow books from other users. online catalog that tells which user owns which book and where it is located, allows you to find copies of the book near you to borrow it.
you have to lend 1 book to borrow one. it already exists, it's called acciobooks in Italy but it doesn't provide for the return of books but it provides the pro version with unlimited books

- I would like something more similar to book crossing where the exchange is peer to peer with return

- in the case of a centralized platform you could think of a model where users can send and take books and it's free as long as the number of books sent is equal to or greater (in that case you have credits) than those requested. you can go under by paying a subscription.
monetization: ads on the site, affiliate links to encourage book purchases on amazon or other bookstores, subscriptions
