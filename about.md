Hi, i'm **Tommy**. 

I'm an entrepreneurship and innovation major now working as an innovation consultant at [Cefriel](https://www.cefriel.com).

My work mainly revolves around digital transformation consulting engagements where we help clients innovate their products, services or entire business models.

On this blog I document my journey as a professional and life-long learner.

Currently I'm learning about Coding, Data Engineering and Cloud Infrastructure, specifically AWS, so that's what I'm going to be writing about, but that might change in the future. 

Outside of work I'm also the president and founder of [Savona Startup](https://www.savonastartup.it), a non-profit organization focused on fostering the entrepreneurial ecosystem in my hometown of Savona, Italy.
