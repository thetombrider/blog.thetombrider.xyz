Hi, i'm **Tommy**. 

**Who?**

I'm an entrepreneurship and innovation major who graduated from the **University of Milan** now working as an innovation consultant at [Cefriel](https://www.cefriel.com).

My work mainly revolves around digital transformation consulting engagements where we help clients innovate their products, services or entire business models.

**Ok, then what?**

As you probably guessed from my studies, I **really** like startups and entrepreneurship. 

Because of this, I'm also the president and founder of [Savona Startup](https://www.savonastartup.it), a non-profit organization focused on fostering the entrepreneurial ecosystem in my hometown of Savona, Italy.

**Why this site**

On this blog I mainly document my mental ramblings but most importantly my journey as a professional and life-long learner (lol I'm 25, who the fuck am I kidding?). It's kind of a [Digital Garden](https://nesslabs.com/digital-garden-set-up). Truth is, I didn't even know what a digital garden was up until a couple of days ago, but since deciding to keep my notes on a site I kind of went down a rabbit hole and found out that what I was doing actually had a name and was "a thing". 

Currently I'm learning about Coding, Data Engineering and Cloud Infrastructure, specifically AWS, so that's what I'm going to be writing about, but that might change in the future. 

Of course, I continuously read and learn things about startups and entrepreneurship, so that's something that will be a default here. 

Other than that, I like to **learn how to learn/think** because I find mental models and tools quite interesting and something that I can use to improve myself and my chances of success.
