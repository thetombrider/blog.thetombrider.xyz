For the longest, I've had a consistency problem.

I start things, projects, but I get bored extremely quickly. 

I've always been like this: as soon as something feels routine, or "too simple", I just move on to something different. 

It's something that bugs me a lot because I think that there is a lot of value in consistency and perseverance and I feel like it's my biggest problem at the moment, as a person and as a professional. 

I'm trying to work on this by trying to be more intentional with every new project or initiative that I start, but it's a slow process. 

I'm quite proud of Savona Startup, the non-profit I started a year ago to try and create a community around tech and entrepreneurship in my city. It's the first time one of my many projects actually spawned something that has a life of his own: the organization exists independently from me, and that's beautiful. I will do my best to make it thrive, but someday I will pass the baton to someone else who will, hopefully, carry the flame forward. 

Anyway, Savona Startup so far is the only project that survived for more than a couple months and I think this has to do with a couple factors:
- I'm not the only variable: there are other people involved that have operational responsibilities and perform many activities related to the organization. 
- It doesn't have an expiry date: the aim of the project is to "create an ecosystem". A goal like this never ends, it will never be "done", so that kind of makes it impossible for me to feel "accomplished" and say: okay, time to do something else. Probably it will happen regardless in the future, but not now. 

All this to say: I need to learn to be more consistent and to see things through more. It's the only way I can see for myself to grow.
