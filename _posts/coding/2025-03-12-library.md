I recently realized that I couldn't find a simple web app I could self-host on my home server to manage my books. All I wanted was a simple database with book details, covers etc, and eventually records for loans if I ever wanted to track books I loaned out to friends. 

I found a solution called ubiblio from a random guy on reddit, here is the repo: LINK, but after trying to install it I realized that I don't want to mess with somebody else's code and I'd just rather roll my own, even if it means having the app in my hands a year from now. 

So far I managed to add basic CRUD to books, users (for friends) and loans. No UI yet (of course).
