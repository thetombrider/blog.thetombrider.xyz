I'm a consultant. As such, I hate taking notes in meetings.

Last year my company had not yet adopted Copilot 365 (we are in that process right now), and I was put on a project where a lot of note taking during meetings was involved. 

Bored as fuck, I decided to make something fun out of it to try and simplify my life, so I coded **Sbobinator**, a very simple **Streamlit** application that takes an audio file, transcribes it, either with diarization or not, and then allows the user to either download the transcription or receive it by email. 

The project is live on Streamlit Cloud at this address: [Sbobinator](https://sbobinator.streamlit.app)

If you don't know Streamlit, I highly recommend you check it out. It's a python library to build simple UIs, particularly geared towards data-heavy applications like dashboards and simple internal tools like CRUD apps or directories.
