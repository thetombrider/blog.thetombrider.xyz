This year i'm trying to read more books. I used to be quite an avid reader when I was in school but since university I almost completely stopped reading books (arguably I was reading a lot of papers and textbooks, so there's that, but still), so I'm trying to improve this in 2025.

I'm interested in entrepreneurship, innovation and tech, so that's what I read about the most.

These are the books I plan on reading in 2025:

- [X] Sprint - Knapp
- [ ] The Right It - Savoia
- [ ] The Mom Test - Fitzpatrick
- [ ] Lean Startup - Ries
- [ ] Design Your Life
- [ ] Deep Work - Newport
- [ ] The Theoretical Minimum - Susskind
- [ ] Algorithms to live by
- [ ] Fundamentals of Data Engineering
- [ ] The Great Mental Models - Parrish
- [ ] A system for writing
- [ ] Algorithms to live by
- [ ] Come fare e ricevere critiche (How to express and receive criticism)

I'll progressively update the list as I read the books or add new ones.

Maybe i'll even write a couple reviews.

Stay tuned ;)
