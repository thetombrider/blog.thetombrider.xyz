Quite a few people have asked me how this blog works, so I thought I'd write a quick post about it.

### The Technology Stack

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that takes Markdown files and transforms them into HTML pages. It's simple, fast, lightweight, and doesn't require a database or server-side processing.

I'm hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means:
1. It's completely free
2. I get version control for all my content
3. I can write posts in Markdown, which is future-proof.

You can see all the code here: [Repo](https://github.com/thetombrider/blog.thetombrider.xyz)

### Content Organization

I use categories and tags extensively to organize content:

- **Categories**: Broad topics like "aws" or "coding" that help organize posts into sections
- **Tags**: More specific keywords that connect related posts across categories

Both have dedicated pages where you can browse all posts with a specific category or tag.

### Writing Workflow

My writing process is super simple:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the appropriate category folder
2. Add YAML frontmatter (the stuff between the `---` lines at the top of each post)
3. Write the post in Markdown
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the site

### Customization

I've customized the default Minima theme with:
- Custom fonts (using SF Pro by Apple)
- Modified layout and styling
- Post navigation between articles
- Category and tag pages
- Quote section on the homepage

### Why I Love This Setup

I really like this approach because:
- No databases to maintain
- No servers to configure
- No CMS interfaces to navigate
- Everything is version-controlled
- I can write in my favorite text editor
- Markdown is perfect for technical writing

For someone who values simplicity and wants to keep control of their content this is a great solution.

That's pretty much it! Simple, fast, and easy to maintain.
