Quite a few people have asked me how this blog works, so I thought I'd write a quick post about it.

### The Technology Stack

This blog is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that takes Markdown files and transforms them into HTML pages. It's simple, fast, lightweight, and doesn't require a database or server-side processing.

I'm hosting it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), which means:
1. It's completely free
2. I get version control for all my content
3. I can write posts in Markdown (which I love)

You can see all the code here: [Repo](https://github.com/thetombrider/blog.thetombrider.xyz)

### Site Structure

My blog's structure is pretty straightforward:

- **Posts**: All my articles are stored as Markdown files in the `_posts` directory, organized in subfolders by category (aws, coding, self-hosting, misc)
- **Pages**: Static pages like About, Books, etc. are stored in the root directory
- **Layouts**: HTML templates that define how the site looks are in the `_layouts` folder
- **Includes**: Reusable components like headers, footers, etc. are in the `_includes` folder

### Content Organization

I use categories and tags extensively to organize content:

- **Categories**: Broad topics like "aws" or "coding" that help organize posts into sections
- **Tags**: More specific keywords that connect related posts across categories

Both have dedicated pages where you can browse all posts with a specific category or tag.

### Writing Workflow

My writing process is super simple:

1. Create a new Markdown file in the appropriate category folder
2. Add YAML frontmatter (the stuff between the `---` lines at the top of each post)
3. Write the post in Markdown
4. Commit and push to GitHub
5. GitHub Pages automatically builds and deploys the site

### Customization

I've customized the default Minima theme with:
- Custom fonts (using SF Pro)
- Modified layout and styling
- Post navigation between articles
- Category and tag pages
- Quote section on the homepage

### Why I Love This Setup

I really like this approach because:
- No databases to maintain
- No servers to configure
- No CMS interfaces to navigate
- Everything is version-controlled
- I can write in my favorite text editor
- Markdown is perfect for technical writing

For someone who values simplicity and doesn't want to deal with WordPress or other complex CMS systems, Jekyll hits the sweet spot.

That's pretty much it! Simple, fast, and easy to maintain.
