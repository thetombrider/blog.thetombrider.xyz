So I decided to start studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification. 

I decided to study for this certification because of work: recently i've been interacting a lot with DevOps and infrastructure people and topics, and so I decided to gain a better understanding to be able to have more informed conversations when the necessity to do so arises. 

Here's what I learned so far:

- AWS has got MANY services and is a very complex infrastructure/platform.
    - It is a global infra built on top of data centers located all over the world. 
    - The AWS infrastructure is organized in "Regions", which are clusters of closely located data centers, which are grouped into Availability Zones.
        - AWS -> Regions -> Availability Zones (AZs) -> Data center(s)

I will probably structure the posts regarding this course in a way that follows the study path, but we'll see.
