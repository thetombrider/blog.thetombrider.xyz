Moving on with the AWS SAA KBRP (that's how i shorten the name of the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Knowledge Base Readiness Path, i guess you can see how that's useful). 

Today I'm tackling databases. 

DBs are the core of most applications as they guarantee the persistance of data in the application. 

AWS offers many different DB solutions:
- RDS
    - compatible with MySQL, MariaDB, Postgres, and with AWS' custom SQL DB, Aurora
- DynamoDB
- DocumentDB
