## Analytics Concepts

Data analysis is the process of analyzing a dataset to make decision. It is a subset of Data Analytics, which is the broader effort of an organization to extract value from data through gathering and analysis of data.

### Analytics

There are 4 types of analytics:

- **Descriptive**: focus on summarizing historical data. Insight into trends and patterns. --> Data visualizaitons.
- **Diagnostic**: Diagnostic analytics is characterized by techniques, such as drill-down, data discovery, data mining, and correlations. In each of these techniques, multiple data operations and transformations are used for analyzing raw data. This form of analytics provides insights and requires human judgment to turn those insights into actionable information.
- **Predictive**: This type uses historical data and statistical algorithms to make forecasts about future outcomes. Predictive analytics is characterized by techniques, such as machine learning, forecasting, pattern matching, and predictive modeling.
- **Prescriptive**:  This technique is based on predictive analytics, but goes one step further and actually recommends actions or responses to the predicted outcome. Prescriptive analytics can analyze the potential implications of different choices and then suggest the best course of action based on those different scenarios. It is characterized by machine learning, graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, and recommendation engines.

### Machine Learning

Definitions:

- **Artificial intelligence (AI)** : A broad branch of
  computer science that is involved with building smart machines that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence.
- **Machine learning (ML) model** : A computer program that is designed to find patterns from an unanalyzed dataset. ML is a subset of AI. Computers use ML to learn from and make
  predictions based on data. ML models can forecast what might happen in the future (predictive analytics) and provide a course of action (prescriptive analytics).
- **ML algorithm** : A computer program that helps
  computers understand hidden patterns in data, make predictions about the data, and recommend actions to take. ML algorithms can analyze huge volumes of data much faster than humans.

Generative AI on AWS

Generative AI is a type of ML model that creates new content and ideas from user prompts. Generative AI learns from existing data
and then uses that knowledge to create new, original content. It is done through a type of ML called deep learning, which uses algorithms to mimic the structure of the human brain. These algorithms, called
artificial neural networks, are inspired by the biological neurons of the human brain and are able to learn complex patterns from data.

Generative AI is powered by large, pre-trained models called foundation models. Generative AI models are trained on massive amounts of data, which can be anything from text to images to music. The model learns the patterns and structures of the data. It then uses that data to make predictions about what the content should look like, similar to the data it was trained on.
