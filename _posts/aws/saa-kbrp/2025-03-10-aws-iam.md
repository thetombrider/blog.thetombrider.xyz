AWS includes a service dedicated to **Identity and Access Management** used to manage access to AWS resources known as **IAM**.

IAM is based on 4 concepts:

- **IAM Policies**: JSON documents which define what can be done on which resource and at what conditions. 

- **IAM Groups**: groups of IAM Users with same Policies.

- **IAM Roles**: IAM roles have IAM policies attached to them and are roles that can be assigned to IAM users to temporarily grant them different IAM policies from their default ones.

- **IAM Users**: credentials used by people and applications to access AWS resources.
