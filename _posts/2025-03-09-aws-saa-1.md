So I decided to start studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certification. 

Here's what I learned so far:

- AWS has MANY services and is a very complex infrastructure/platform.
- The course is LONG, but looks interesting. (I'm following the dedicated Knowledge Path on AWS Skill Builder)

I will probably structure the posts regarding this course to follow the study path, but we'll see.
