### 2025 Reading List

This year i'm trying to read more books. I used to be quite an avid reader when I was in school but since university I almost completely stopped reading books (arguably I was reading a lot of papers and textbooks, so there's that, but still), so I'm trying to improve this in 2025.

I'm interested in entrepreneurship, innovation and tech, so that's what I read about the most.

These are the books I plan on reading in 2025:

### Startups / Product Management / Entrepreneurship

- [X] Sprint - Jake Knapp
- [ ] The Right It - Alberto Savoia - **Currently Reading**
- [ ] The Mom Test - Rob Fitzpatrick
- [ ] Lean Startup - Eric Ries
- [ ] When Kale and Coffee Compete
- [ ] Business Model Generation - Alex Osterwalder

### General self improvement

- [ ] Design Your Life
- [ ] Deep Work - Cal Newport
- [ ] Algorithms to live by
- [ ] The Great Mental Models - Shane Parrish
- [ ] A system for writing
- [ ] Come fare e ricevere critiche (How to express and receive criticism)

### Physics

- [ ] The Theoretical Minimum - Leonard Susskind

### Data Engineering

- [ ] Fundamentals of Data Engineering

### Cloud Infrastructure

- [ ] Solutions Architect Handbook


I'll progressively update the list as I read the books or add new ones.

Maybe i'll even write a couple reviews.

Stay tuned ;)
